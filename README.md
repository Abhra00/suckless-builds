# This is the fork of my suckless softwares to check how far I can go with manual patching
# NOTE
  # I will not maintain this fork further because It is too much of a hassle so I will move to bakkeby's flexipatch
 
  # Installation of suckless software
  
  ```bash
make
sudo make clean install
```
